INTRO- My name is Amrita Singh. I am from Section C, IT branch. My hometown is Meerut ,Uttar Pradesh. 
INCIDENT- Every morning, I go late to class, thinking i will be the last. But every day, I find out I am actually the first one.
FUNNY- During Treasure Hunt my team completed four tasks, only to find out later that all of them were fake clues! We found the fake Qrs  :| . We couldn’t stop laughing at how seriously we had taken them.
